# Noel's Coder Template
This template was imported from the [auguwu/coder-images](https://github.com/auguwu/coder-images/tree/master/template) repository. This is a base template that allows you to develop on Coder with Noel's personal preferences, but you can easily customize this template if you wish!

This template also includes a privileged, sidecar container for Docker usage. In the future, we do plan to make this as a seperate template.

## Template Import
```shell
$ coder templates create noel --url=<coder instance here>
```
