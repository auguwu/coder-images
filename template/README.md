# Noel's Coder Template
This template was imported from the [auguwu/coder-images](https://github.com/auguwu/coder-images/tree/master/template) repository. This is a base template that allows you to develop on Coder with Noel's personal preferences, but you can easily customize this template if you wish!

The template is based on Docker, so you will need to run Coder in a Docker enviornment to use this image effectly but, you can easily modify it to use
Kubernetes.

## Template Import
```shell
$ coder templates create noel --url=<coder instance here>
```
